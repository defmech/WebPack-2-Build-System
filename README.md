# WebPack-2-Build-System
WebPack 2 build system using ExtractTextPlugin for external CSS. 

This is my build system for an ES6 project with external CSS and livereload. It will build .scss files into an autoprefixed and minified external css file.

`npm install` then `npm run dev` to start the livereload and webpack build. Changes to sccs files no not cause whole page reloads.
