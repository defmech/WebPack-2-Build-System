# WebPack-3-Build-System
WebPack 3 build system using ExtractTextPlugin for external CSS. 

This is my build system for an ES6 project with external CSS. It will build .scss files into an autoprefixed and minified external css file.

Yarn `yarn install` then `yarn run dev` to continually build.

NPM `npm install` then `npm run dev` to continually build.
